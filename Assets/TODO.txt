Chromatose eventual To-Do

Code Cleanup
* Give Animate optional delegate callbacks
* Give Animate AnimationCurves for color and timing
* Change from my custom NotificationCenter pattern to event handling
* Make PlayerHealth and EnemyHealth children of Health. (And change that null reference thing in BackgroundColor; it's ugly).
* Move ALL bpm/secondsperbeat/etc into LevelMusic, and make a secondsPerHalfMeasure.

Design
* Figure out how to make boost more timed to the beat.
